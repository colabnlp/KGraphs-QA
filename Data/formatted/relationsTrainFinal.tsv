HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :	None
This is a 59 year old male with a past medical history significant for an atrioseptal defect repair at age 18 , congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45% and a recent cardiac myocardial infarction , pulmonary hypertension and mitral regurgitation , and atrial fibrillation .	None
He was seen by his primary care physician the day before admission and complained of two weeks of increasing shortness of breath and fatigue , weight gain and abdominal fullness .	None
He was sent to the Emergency Department for further evaluation .	None
The patient reported feeling at his baseline with chronic mild dyspnea on exertion until two weeks prior to admission .	None
During this period he had also been weaned off of his Digoxin starting early in February .	None
Over the two weeks prior to admission he had noticed an increasing heart rate from his baseline in the 60s to a heart rate in the 120s .	None
He had also some increased shortness of breath and a 10 pound weight gain and new three to four pillow orthopnea with a dry cough .	None
He denied fevers , chills , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or diaphoresis .	None
Atrioseptal defect repair in 1970 , cardiomyopathy , right-sided congestive heart failure , pulmonary hypertension , history of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter , history of prostate cancer , status post brachytherapy , history of rectal bleeding , obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP .	None

Moderate to severe 3+ mitral regurgitation and 3+ tricuspid regurgitation along with moderate pulmonary early systolic hypertension .	None
Of note , this echocardiogram was performed when the patient was tachycardiac .	None
1. Hypotension - The patient was initially mildly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s .	None
Upon admission it was unclear whether or not the patient was volume overloaded or volume depleted .	None
However , subsequent it was determined that the patient 's hypotension may have been related to his rapid ventricular response and right heart failure .	None
It was felt that this potentially had lead to his atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response .	None
In addition the patient was started on Verapamil since his heart rate had remained mildly tachycardiac in the low 100s .	None
3. Congestive heart failure - During the initial course of the patient 's admission , it was unclear as to whether or not he was volume overloaded or volume depleted .	None
The decision was made to have the patient undergo a cardiac catheterization to fully evaluate the hemodynamics to determine the etiology of the patient 's heart failure .	None
Again seen was a slightly irregular contour of the liver with dilated hepatic veins suggesting chronic hepatic vascular congestion .	None
It was felt that he may have had some component of vascular congestion from his congestive heart failure as well as possibly some mild cirrhotic changes secondary to his previous alcohol use .	None
5. Fall - The patient had a mechanical fall during his admission .	None
He did not sleep at all the night before and was extremely fatigued .	None
He was walking in the hall , dragging his intravenous pole when he tripped over the foot of the pole and lost his balance .	None
